# solidarity-game

**Solidarity** is a game, where we work together to make the worlds and futures we desire. Sort of like *Civilization* or *World of Warcraf*t, except in real-life.

Instead of fighting dragons, we create the futures we wish for --- resisting fossil fuel infrastructure, ending ecological degradation, and transforming our local systems. And when we k̴i̴l̴l̴ ̴a̴ ̴d̴r̴a̴g̴o̴n̴ realize a desired future, we all enjoy the resources and opportunities it provides.

Imagine one such situation: [stopping the Adani coal plant](https://www.stopadani.com/why_stop_adani) in Australia. If we stop that coal project, we'll save 4.6 billion tons of emissions and 270 billion liters of groundwater, protect the Great Barrier Reef from 500 passing coal ships every year, and support our Wangan and Jagalingou relatives. Now that you know what's at stake, what will you do?

The purpose of the game is to realize the futures we wish for, through coordination and solidarity. Our futures are intertwined, all across the globe. As Indigenous communities resist fossil fuel infrastructure (and genocide), they save our air, water, and biodiversity. As the students march in the streets and fight Big Oil in court, they shift paradigms and systems. As communities localize their ways of life, they lower the emissions and warming of our shared atmosphere. We're all in this together. What if we coordinate our attention, our energy, and our capital (social, cultural, paradigmatic) --- and start living like it?

Sending support to communities on the frontlines. Contributing to arts and stories and movements that shift paradigms. Finding ways to support our allies the best we can, and leading change in our own communities as well.

Because the stakes are real. This is real *lives* --- of our human relatives, today and in the future. Of insects, mammals, fish and cephalopods. Of fauna and fungi, of rivers and mycelia and glaciers. If you/we take actions that move us further from the futures we wish for, by neglect or accident, we're further from the futures we wish for. If you/we fail to engage and take action at all, we're just as far from those futures as well.

And our successes are real too. Can you imagine the celebration of falling a fossil fuel project? Of phasing out a destructive corporation? Of individuals and communities, transcending our status quos (petrodollars, consumption, military industrial complex, technological dystopia) --- and the celebrations of new opportunities to come? We've experienced these victories, now and then. And yet, these challenges us are facing us every day. The opportunities for better futures are greeting us every moment.

This is our futures and todays in our hands. Our cultures, our non-human relatives, our resources and future abundance, our peace and prosperity and social capital and self-determination. Like it or not, we're playing. It's already begun. What will we do?

One of the first actions you can take is supporting this grant. Your contribution (and matched funds) will be distributed to organizations on the frontlines of fossil fuel resistance movements. You'll receive credit for this support, so when the Adani coal plant falls --- you'll see rewards in the strengthening of atmosphere, groundwater, Great Barrier Reef, and Indigenous cultures. The atoms and spirits of the futures we wish to realize.

And you can do much more than that as well --- anything, as long as it's in *solidarity with* and *consented by* with those we wish to support. Create art and stories to share the voices of frontline communities. Amplify their voices and leadership amongst our networks. Hold local gatherings to talk about these issues, and get our neighbors engaging with us.

And of course, organizing for change in the communities where we live as well.

The possibilities are as endless as our shared imaginations and capacity. The prosperity of our futures will be determined by our successes.

This game --- with credits, coordination, stories and art, and points for falling coal plants (eventually recorded on IPFS) --- is simply a lense on reality, to help us wake up and pick up our agency. Because we're already playing. And it's our futures --- 2 or 3 degrees of warming, biodiversity or extinction, transformation or status quo --- that will be determined by our actions. Let's begin.

Any input, criticisms, questions, feedback all welcome. If you have any concerns or see potential harms from something like this, please share that as well. The purpose of this is simply to support outcomes --- so if it doesn't seem pragmatic/wise, or there could be any other issues, there's no ego or attachment to the concept. I believe it's best to explore with others and see different perspectives!

On a practical note, I'd see the start of this as basically enabling people to share actions of solidarity they've made, record those actions on IPFS (if desired), and have some basic game-like concepts around that. More "Stack Overflow" than gamification really --- where the main metrics, just come back to how much you've helped and contributed to these futures. So more intrinsic motivation than external. And perhaps reputation, personal pride, sort of like badges (e.g. being able to look back and say "I participated, those are the outcomes I helped to support")
